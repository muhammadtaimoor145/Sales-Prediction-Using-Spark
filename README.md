**Sales Prediction System**

This project is a Sales Prediction System designed to predict future sales based on historical data. It involves data cleaning, preprocessing, building a decision tree model, and deploying the model as a REST API using Flask on Heroku.

**Features**

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Utilizes PySpark on Databricks to handle large datasets efficiently.

Predictive Modeling: Builds a Decision Tree model to predict future sales.

REST API: Exposes the model as a Flask API for seamless integration with other applications.

Deployment: Hosted on Heroku for easy accessibility and scalability.

**Technologies Used**

PySpark: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation.

Databricks: Cloud-based platform for big data analytics.

Scikit-Learn: For building the Decision Tree model.

Flask: Lightweight web framework for building the REST API.

Heroku: Cloud platform for deploying and managing the web application.
